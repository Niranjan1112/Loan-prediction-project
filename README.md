# Foundations of Data Analytics(FDA) Project

## 1. Problem Statement
The credit system is a vital source of income for banks, as it generates profit through loan interest. Accurate prediction of loan defaulters is critical for reducing non-performing assets and ensuring loan recovery without losses. By forecasting defaulters, banks can improve their financial performance and mitigate risks. Machine learning offers an effective approach to tackle this issue by analyzing data patterns and automating decisions. Unlike traditional methods, machine learning minimizes human intervention and optimizes processes like client evaluation and credit approval. This predictive system enables banks to assess the reliability of applicants efficiently, safeguarding their wealth and improving the overall loan distribution process.

## 2. Objective and Approach
This project utilizes machine learning to predict loan approvals by analyzing applicant data. The process involves data pre-processing, addressing missing values, conducting exploratory data analysis, and applying various machine learning models. By automating the verification of applicant characteristics, the system predicts whether an applicant is creditworthy. This not only streamlines decision-making for bank employees but also provides clarity to applicants regarding their loan status.

## 3. Results
The implemented machine learning models like Naive bayes, Random forest classifier and Decision tree achieved accuracy ranging from 75% to 85% on the test dataset, RFC performed better than DT3 and NB. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of machine learning in predicting loan acceptance and improving the reliability of credit forecasting, ultimately benefiting both banks and their clients.
